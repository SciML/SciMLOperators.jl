A lazy operator algebra is also defined for AbstractSciMLOperators.\n\nMathematical Notation\n\nAn AbstractSciMLOperator L is an operator which is used to represent the following type of equation:\n\nw = L(upt)v\n\nwhere L[v] is the operator application of L on the vector v.\n\nInterface\n\nAn AbstractSciMLOperator can be called  like a function in the following ways:\n\nL(v, u, p, t) - Out-of-place application where v is the action vector and u is the update vector\nL(w, v, u, p, t) - In-place application where w is the destination, v is the action vector, and u is the update vector\nL(w, v, u, p, t, α, β) - In-place application with scaling: w = α*(L*v) + β*w\n\nOperator state can be updated separately from application:\n\nupdate_coefficients!(L, u, p, t) for in-place operator update\nL = update_coefficients(L, u, p, t) for out-of-place operator update\n\nSciMLOperators also overloads Base.*, LinearAlgebra.mul!, LinearAlgebra.ldiv! for operator evaluation without updating operator state. An AbstractSciMLOperator behaves like a matrix in these methods. Allocation-free methods, suffixed with a ! often need cache arrays. To precache an AbstractSciMLOperator, call the function L = cache_operator(L, input_vector).\n\nOverloaded Actions\n\nThe behavior of a SciMLOperator is indistinguishable from an AbstractMatrix. These operators can be passed to linear solver packages, and even to ordinary differential equation solvers. The list of overloads to the AbstractMatrix interface includes, but is not limited to, the following:\n\nBase: size, zero, one, +, -, *, /, \\, ∘, inv, adjoint, transpose, convert\nLinearAlgebra: mul!, ldiv!, lmul!, rmul!, factorize, issymmetric, ishermitian, isposdef\nSparseArrays: sparse, issparse\n\nMultidimensional arrays and batching\n\nSciMLOperator can also be applied to AbstractMatrix subtypes where operator-evaluation is done column-wise.\n\nK = 10\nu_mat = rand(N, K)\n\nv_mat = F(u_mat, p, t) # == mul!(v_mat, F, u_mat)\nsize(v_mat) == (N, K) # true\n\nL can also be applied to AbstractArrays that are not AbstractVecOrMats so long as their size in the first dimension is appropriate for matrix-multiplication. Internally, SciMLOperators reshapes an N-dimensional array to an AbstractMatrix, and applies the operator via matrix-multiplication.\n\nOperator update\n\nThis package can also be used to write state-dependent, time-dependent, and parameter-dependent operators, whose state can be updated per a user-defined function. The updates can be done in-place, i.e. by mutating the object, or out-of-place, i.e. in a non-mutating, Zygote-compatible way.\n\nFor example,\n\nu = rand(N)\np = rand(N)\nt = rand()\n\n# out-of-place update\nmat_update_func = (A, u, p, t) -> t * (p * u')\nsca_update_func = (a, u, p, t) -> t * sum(p)\n\nM = MatrixOperator(zero(N, N); update_func = mat_update_func)\nα = ScalarOperator(zero(Float64); update_func = sca_update_func)\n\nL = α * M\nL = cache_operator(L, v)\n\n# L is initialized with zero state\nL * v == zeros(N) # true\n\n# update operator state with `(u, p, t)`\nL = update_coefficients(L, u, p, t)\n# and multiply\nL * v != zeros(N) # true\n\n# updates state and evaluates L*v at (u, p, t)\nL(v, u, p, t) != zeros(N) # true\n\nThe out-of-place evaluation function L(v, u, p, t) calls update_coefficients under the hood, which recursively calls the update_func for each component SciMLOperator. Therefore, the out-of-place evaluation function is equivalent to calling update_coefficients followed by Base.*. Notice that the out-of-place evaluation does not return the updated operator.\n\nOn the other hand, the in-place evaluation function, L(w, v, u, p, t), mutates L, and is equivalent to calling update_coefficients! followed by mul!. The in-place update behavior works the same way, with a few <!>s appended here and there. For example,\n\nw = rand(N)\nv = rand(N)\nu = rand(N)\np = rand(N)\nt = rand()\n\n# in-place update\n_A = rand(N, N)\n_d = rand(N)\nmat_update_func! = (A, u, p, t) -> (copy!(A, _A); lmul!(t, A); nothing)\ndiag_update_func! = (diag, u, p, t) -> copy!(diag, N)\n\nM = MatrixOperator(zero(N, N); update_func! = mat_update_func!)\nD = DiagonalOperator(zero(N); update_func! = diag_update_func!)\n\nL = D * M\nL = cache_operator(L, v)\n\n# L is initialized with zero state\nL * v == zeros(N) # true\n\n# update L in-place\nupdate_coefficients!(L, v, p, t)\n# and multiply\nmul!(w, v, u, p, t) != zero(N) # true\n\n# updates L in-place, and evaluates w=L*v at (u, p, t)\nL(w, v, u, p, t) != zero(N) # true\n\nThe update behavior makes this package flexible enough to be used in OrdinaryDiffEq. As the parameter object p is often reserved for sensitivity computation via automatic-differentiation, a user may prefer to pass in state information via other arguments. For that reason, we allow update functions with arbitrary keyword arguments.\n\nmat_update_func = (A, u, p, t; scale = 0.0) -> scale * (p * u')\n\nM = MatrixOperator(zero(N, N); update_func = mat_update_func,\n    accepted_kwargs = (:state,))\n\nM(v, u, p, t) == zeros(N) # true\nM(v, u, p, t; scale = 1.0) != zero(N)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"interface/#Interface-API-Reference","page":"The AbstractSciMLOperator Interface","title":"Interface API Reference","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"interface/#SciMLOperators.update_coefficients","page":"The AbstractSciMLOperator Interface","title":"SciMLOperators.update_coefficients","text":"update_coefficients(L, u, p, t; kwargs...)\n\n\nUpdate the state of L based on u, input vector, p parameter object, t, and keyword arguments.

SciMLOperators.jl defines the abstract interface for how operators in the SciML ecosystem are supposed to be defined. It gives the common set of functions and traits that solvers can rely on for properly performing their tasks. Along with that, SciMLOperators.jl provides definitions for the basic standard operators that are used as building blocks for most tasks, simplifying the use of operators while also demonstrating to users how such operators can be built and used in practice.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"SciMLOperators.jl has the design that is required to be used in all scenarios of equation solvers. For example, Magnus integrators for differential equations require defining an operator u = A(t) u, while Munthe-Kaas methods require defining operators of the form u = A(u) u. Thus, the operators need some form of time and state dependence, which the solvers can update and query when they are non-constant (update_coefficients!). Additionally, the operators need the ability to act like “normal” functions for equation solvers. For example, if A(v,u,p,t) has the same operation as update_coefficients(A, u, p, t); A * v, then A can be used in any place where a differential equation definition (u,p,t) -> A(u, u, p, t) is used without requiring the user or solver to do any extra work.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Another example is state-dependent mass matrices. M(u,p,t)*u' = f(u,p,t). When solving such an equation, the solver must understand how to \"update M\" during operations, and thus the ability to update the state of M is a required function in the interface. This is also required for the definition of Jacobians J(u,p,t) in order to be properly used with Krylov methods inside of ODE solves without reconstructing the matrix-free operator at each step.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Thus while previous good efforts for matrix-free operators have existed in the Julia ecosystem, such as LinearMaps.jl, those operator interfaces lack these aspects to actually be fully seamless with downstream equation solvers.
